## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Inter-party divide in the Democratic party is usually based on ideological differences (Vargas, 2018). This ideological fracture is characterised by the moderate and progressive wing of the party. Although sharing some of the same goals, the moderate Democrats tend to favour slow, incremental change, whereas the progressive Democrats distinguish themselves as activists advocating for populist policies such as Medicare For All (Vargas, 2018). The conflict between the two wings of the Democratic party was highlighted by the Green New Deal solution proposed by U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and U.S. Senator Markey (Vargas, 2018). The Green New Deal is the first comprehensive proposal to combine climate change mitigation and the elimination of economic inequality (Galvin & Healy, 2020). The majority of progressive Democrats, such as Senator Bernie Sanders, support and have signed the Green New Deal proposal, whereas some moderates, such as Representative Diane Feinstein, are more critical of it (King, 2021). This inter-party difference in how Democrats tackle and approach climate change is what this paper wishes to explore further. We want to explore how the progressive and moderate Democrats frame and approach climate change and sustainability on social media, focusing on Twitter, Facebook, and their official websites.

We decided to approach this topic using agenda setting theory. Agenda setting theory refers to mediaâ€™s selection and portrayal of certain issues, which leads people to perceive those issues as more important than others and aids in their interpretation of those issues (Wu & Coleman, 2009) . There are two levels of the theory: the first level concerns the amount of coverage of a certain issue, whereas the second level concerns how the issue is portrayed. Previous research investigating political communication and agenda setting usually analyse traditional media, such as news articles and political speeches (ibid.). However, there is a push toward analysing social media communication instead, but there is lack of research in this area (Jungherr, 2016). The need to analyse social media communications stems in the rise of politicians' use of social media, where they can communicate with the public, as well as engage with political opponents (Gilardi et al., 2021). 
 
 We wish to add to the literature of analysing political communication on social media, through the lense of agenda setting theory. However, the aim of our paper is to explore the communication patterns of the two Democratic wings, i.e.,  the moderates and progressives, not to investigate what influence they have on the public's perception of topic importance and its interpretation, which is why we will use agenda setting as merely a lense for our work. We will focus on the two levels of agenda setting. Namely, what they post regarding environmental sustainability, as well as how they frame these posts. The difference in this study and the majority of literature related to agenda setting is that we will have an open-ended question focusing on the patterns emerging, rather than a set hypothesis concerning the differences in communication between the factions (Gilardi et al., 2021). As we will employ a variety of quantitative and qualitative analyses, we seek a broad research focus, especially since the digital ethnographic work underpinning our study prioritises inductive exploration (Kozinets, 2019). Our inquiry focuses on the communication of over 200 politicians on two social media platforms, which broadens the scope of the research, rather than focusing on specific individuals or just one platform. Based on this, our research question is:

 
<em> RQ: How do progressive and moderate U.S Democrats approach the topic of climate change and sustainability on social media?</em>
 
Our research design will include netnographic work, network analyses, and a content analysis. The data in the analysis was gathered from Twitter and Facebook, and the netnography was complemented with data from official government websites. We delineate two wings of the Democratic Party, the moderates and the progressives, by examining the two largest congressional coalitions that relate to the two factions, the New Democrats and the Congressional Progressive Caucus (Thomsen, 2018). In the rest of this paper, the term moderates will refer to the members of the New Democrats, and the term progressives will refer to the members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Data for the automated network analysis and content analysis was gathered using the Tweepy-API. The actor set included all 110 members of the New Democrats and all 91 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, all of which currently hold office. The members were either U.S. Senators or Representatives. We chose to collect tweets from the politicians' feeds. Due to a limitation of the Tweepy-API, we only gathered the 3,200 most recent tweets from each of the politicians in our defined actor set. This limitation means that politicians who tweet more often have a shorter timeline than politicians who tweet less often in our dataset. The Twitter data were gathered on 8-11 May 2021. The Twitter data for the progressives contains 286,668 tweets, and the dataset for the moderates contains 322,512 tweets.

The netnographic section will follow our immersion journal where we followed the top 20 politicians from the progressive and moderate wing on Facebook, Twitter, and their official websites on posts regarding climate change and sustainability. A manual network, which demonstrates how the Democrats relate to other actors when discussing climate change and sustainability, will be included. We will then conduct an automated network analysis to explore the relations between the two wings, based on Twitter mentions. In our content analysis, we will create a PCA model to investigate the placement of politicians' climate agendas in relation to one another.
